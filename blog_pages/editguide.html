      <h1>Photo/Film Editing Guide</h1>
      <p>My perspective on what adjustments on contrast, saturation, tone and colors you can make to your photo/films, to portray the feeling you want your work to give off. <br><br>
        
      </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Lower contrast, higher saturation </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Generally gives vibrant, lively, "carefree" animated vibes. </li>
      <li>The color richness may even portray an "anime-like" feel (e.g. Studio Ghibli scenery)</li>
      <li>When neither very deep shadows nor strong highlights (low contrast) are present, the color richness present may give a 2D perspective. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Selfie Expression Types: <br> Brief Analysis Relating to Conveyed Professionalism</h2>
    <h3>Smiling Selfies</h3>
    <p>Depending on the lighting pre or post photoshoot, a more dimmed exposure may convey streaks of nostalgic memories. These type of selfies might seem more professional. </p><br><br>
    <img width=50% src="/blog_images/selfievs2.png">
    <br><br>
    <h3>Contemptuous Selfies</h3>
    <p>A current trend among selfies especially from teenagers is to put on a contemptuous look, espressing superiority, being indifferent and nonchalant to whatever else is going on. Those who want to express a "quirky" trait might stick out their tongues, cross their eyes, bite their lips, "agressively" bite their fingers, etc.  </p> <br><br>
    <img width=50% src="/blog_images/selfievs3.png"><br><br>
    <p>The unprofessionalism coming from these types of selfies originate from the "eye crossing", "agressive finger bite", and sometimes middle finger.  </p>

    
    <h2 id="easyselfieideasforyou">Easy Ideas for You </h2>
    <p> Does your built-in phone camera app distort your facial features? Don't worry- No one really notices the difference. However, I suggest downloading a "camera pro" app like Camera+ to preserve your unique features without using a beauty camera/filter, although you still can. Make sure you can <b>actually zoom in to different scales </b> (such that it may indicate something like 1x, 1.5x, 2x, etc.) when taking a selfie. Position your phone away from your face and zoom in. <br><br>
      To make a selfie-like self portrait, you may try the following: <br><br>
      → Position your hand up against your jaw, and "feel" your cheek or shoulder. Slightly tilt your head and look away from camera for an expression of "elegance/confidence". Keep in mind, you may unintentionally express different emotions depending on your hairstyle, fashion, makeup, etc. For this type of photo, it is optimal if your neck and shoulders are in-frame. <br><br>
      <img width=25% src="/blog_images/selfievs1.png"><br><br> (Above photo taken with iPhone App Camera+, edited with built-in adjustments and "Noir" filter. No make up (I don't know how anyways) and no make up camera used. I increased noise reduction to reduce a "grainy" texture the photo exhibited, since the photo was taken when zoomed.)<br><br>
      → Stare straight into the camera with your chin slightly up and head centered in-frame. Greyscaling the photo might be a good idea if you want to make skin blemishes less noticeable. For this particular pose, you might want to make your features, especially eyes, more prominent (beauty app or make up), since the main focus is going to be your lips and up. 
      <br><br>
      → You can also put your palm against the camera, to cover part of your face. This might create a sense of mystery on your face.<br><br>
      → Experiment with what you choose to blur. As seen in the two photos below, the different in focus (one on hand, other on face) can create a slight difference in how a viewer perceives the photo. <br><br>

    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Selfies and self portraits each convey different messages, so don't compare one's strength with the other's flaw! Most importantly, it's up to you what you want your self portrait to express. Happy photo-taking!</p>
